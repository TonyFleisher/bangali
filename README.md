<h2 style="padding-top: 27px">Rooms Manager with Rooms Occupancy for Smartthings and Hubitat</h2>

<p style="padding-top: 35px">While ST has a concept of rooms it is essentially a grouping mechanism which does not enable automation. In contrast rooms occupancy considers the room as a meta device and automates common tasks associated with a ‚Äúroom‚Äù physical or virtual. <strong>What makes it really useful is not just the room's occupancy state but the ability to manage automation for rooms in a set of rules for the room based on the occupancy state of the room and data from various sensors.</strong> When creating a room device through the smartapp you are able to create these rules for the rooms making your rooms really smart.</p>

<p>What these rules enable is many common tasks around rooms which most users go through automating at some point. Usually through setting up a few rules or creating a few pistons. I have been there and done that myself. While those work to a degree, it does not enable the kind of comprehensive automation that should be possible for devices in a room based on sensor inputs. This smartapp makes that possible.</p>

<p>If there is one principle that these apps are built on, it is - that your home automation should work in the background in a repeatable and predictable manner without requiring periodic human intervention. In short - your automation should work for you and not the other way around. <i>But even more importantly perhaps, this app gets you the kind of WAF for your home automation that you have always dreamed about.</i> üôÇ</p>

<p>Additionally, these room occupancy devices also have attributes, capabilities and commands which are useable in webCoRE or other smartapps like Smart Lighting in ST or Rule Machine in Hubitat. There is a range of other automations that webCoRE makes possible that could not otherwise be done without writing a custom smartapp for it. I use webCoRE for that and am I big fan of Adrian. So checkout webCoRE as well if you don't already use it.</p>

<h4>How does this app work?</h4>

<p><i>This app works by setting rooms occupancy to various states based on a set of sensors as specified by the user. It takes this state and attribute values from various sensors and evaluates a set of rules that you create to match the conditions. When all of the conditions for the rule matches, it executes actions specified on these matching rules.</i></p>

<p>As an example, you can specify motion sensors in Occupied settings to set a room state to Occupied when there is motion from any of those motion sensors. Then create a rule to turn on some lights. In this rule you could also set that these lights should only be turned on if a lux sensor is at a certain lux value or lower. Or you could specify that only turn on the lights during certain times. Or you could specify turn on the lights at a certain level during certain times and at another level during other times.</p>

<p>As a part of the Occupied settings you can also specify timeout values so the room does not indefinitely stay set to Occupied state and the lights turn off after a while when there is no motion. How quickly that happens is controlled by you through the timeout value you specify in the settings. By specifying settings in the Checking settings you are also able to dim the lights before the lights turn off completely so there is a visual cue to the room occupant that the lights will turn off because they have not moved in a while.</p>

<p>Off course you may be in the room while and not be moving for a while like reading a book or watching TV. That's when you use the Engaged settings to set the room to Engaged state. See below for additional details.</p>

<h4>Here are the common room occupancy states:</h4>

<ul>
    <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/adey/bangali/master/resources/icons/roomsOccupiedState.png" width="125" style="float:left; width:80px; height:50px; padding-right: 30px;">
        <h5>Occupied:</h5>
    <p>Occupied is you go to a room are in there for a few minutes then leave the room. Lights come on when you enter the room and turn off after a couple of minutes of your leaving the room. Think of Occupied as a transient state and Engaged below as a somewhat persistent state.</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/adey/bangali/master/resources/icons/roomsEngagedState.png" width="125" style="float:left; width:80px; height:50px; padding-right: 30px;">
        <h5>Engaged:</h5>
    <p>Engaged is when you stay in a room for an extended period of time and may be motionless for some or all of the time. since we cant depend on the motion event for engaged state there are different options to set the room to engaged for extended occupancy. these are all under engaged settings and there is more coming. but these help make sure the switches you set to on stay on even if there is no motion in the room. When in Engaged state you have a different and longer timeout state than the Occupied state. So there is still a motion requirement but a much higher time threshold than the Occupied state.</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/adey/bangali/master/resources/icons/roomsAsleepState.png" width="125" style="float:left; width:80px; height:50px; padding-right: 30px;">
        <h5>Asleep:</h5>
    <p>Asleep state is meant for use while the room should be 'asleep' as in not respond to most typical automation like motion automation. But it does allow for other automation like using a night light and using a button to turn on or off the night lights. You are still able to create rules for the Asleep state but it additionally support a little bit for Asleep state specific automation in the Asleep settings.</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/adey/bangali/master/resources/icons/roomsVacantState.png" width="125" style="float:left; width:80px; height:50px; padding-right: 30px;">
        <h5>Vacant:</h5>
    <p>Vacant state is for when the room is vacant and you want everything to get turned off. It is possible to setup rules for Vacant settings as well but not required.</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/adey/bangali/master/resources/icons/roomsCheckingState.png" width="125" style="float:left; width:80px; height:50px; padding-right: 30px;">
        <h5>Checking:</h5>
    <p>Occupied state is used for transition between states and not user controlled. For example, when moving from Occupied to Vacant occupancy state the room will transition to Checking state. While the app does not allow creating rules for checking state there is some settings available to control dimming of the lights when in Checking state.</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/adey/bangali/master/resources/icons/roomsLockedState.png" width="125" style="float:left; width:80px; height:50px; padding-right: 30px;">
        <h5>Locked:</h5>
    <p>Locked state disables all automations for the room and allows you to control lights and other devices in the room either manually or some other way.</p>
</ul>

<p>The states 'locked', 'reserved', 'kaput' and 'donotdisturb' are effectively all similar in that they all disable automation. That being the case there is some sensors allowed to set / unset rooms to / from Locked state but no other automation beyond that for these occupancy states. Here is a quick description of the various top level settings and how the app works. <i>At the heart of the app is the concept of room states and rules to automate devices based on these room's states and other sensor inputs.</i> (In the following description when I talk about sensors it refers to devices that have attributes which are used to drive decisions in the room's rules.)</p>

<p><i>Note: Many of the following settings are optional but when specified will require other settings to be specified. Like specifying a motion sensor is optional. But if you do specify a motion sensor the motion event to trigger timeout countdown becomes required.</i></p>

<p>Then go to ST app -> Automation tab -> Add a Smartapp -> My apps in ST app and install rooms manager app then create your rooms within rooms manager.</p>

<h5>When creating a room first give the room a name and save the room then go back in to the room to add various settings to the room. This is because the app uses app state to manage the rules and in ST the app state is not consistent till the app has been saved once.</h5>

<h5>Non-obvious rules:</h5>
<p>1. Outdoor lights with no motion sensor?
    <ul>
        Setup a room say `Outdoor` with the following settings specified for the rule:  
        <ul>
            <table class="wikitable" style="width:100%">
                <tr>
                    <td style="width:90%">Name of the rule.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Time from and to settings when the lights should turn on and off respectively. </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Lights or other switches to turn off.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Optionally you can also specify the level, color and color temperature or use a Holiday Light rule that you have setup.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </ul>
        The light will turn on at the time from time and turn off at the time to time. Off course you could create multiple such rules in this Outdoor room to turn off different lights at different times even on different days of the week.
    </ul>
</p>
<p>2. Turn off switches after X seconds with no motion sensor? (power saver)
    <ul>
        Setup a room with the following Engaged settings:  
        <ul>
            <table class="wikitable" style="width:100%">
                <tr>
                    <td style="width:90%">Set the switches you want turned off as engaged switches.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Specify the seconds after which you want the light turned off as the timeout setting.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </ul>
        Then add a rule with the following settings:  
        <ul>
            <table class="wikitable" style="width:100%">
                <tr>
                    <td style="width:90%">Name of the rule.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>From the state drop down pick state as Engaged.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>All switches in Engaged settings as switches to turn on.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </ul>
        Any of those lights when turned on will be turned off after that specified number of seconds.  
    </ul>
</p>
